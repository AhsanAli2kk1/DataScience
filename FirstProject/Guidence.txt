Month 01 (Mini-project) Data Analysis
It is time for a project that covers all the concepts you have learned so far: Data Analysis. I have provided you with a dataset of university enrollment. The university has started offering online courses to reach a wider range of students and wants your help to understand enrollment trends. You are asked to use the concepts you have learned, such as statistics, data cleaning, transformations (if needed), and visualizations, to find important insights from the dataset. Specifically, identify what contributes to higher enrollment and determine if the course type (online or classroom) is a significant factor. This is an unguided project, so you will need to apply your understanding independently as no guided questions will be provided.
